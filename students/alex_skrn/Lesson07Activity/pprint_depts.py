"""Lesson07activity - Create a department table for the db and query the db.

In this exercise, based on instructor-provided code, a very simply
HR-like database is created.
The db contains 3 tables:
    person (PK: person name)
    job (PK: job name; FK: person name)
    department (no PK 'cos no unique fields; FK: job name)

From Activity description: "Finally, produce a list using pretty print that
shows all of the departments a person worked in for every job they ever had."

In this exercise, I wrote pprint_depts.py  and populate_debt_db.py
and modified personjobdept_model.py.
