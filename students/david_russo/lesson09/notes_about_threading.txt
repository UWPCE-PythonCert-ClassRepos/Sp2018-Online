As we increase the number of threads, the performance improves. As has been noted in the Advanced Python Slack Channel, it is fairly easy to hit the limit of 1000 requests within a 24 hour period. It appears to run a little slower than the Async version, but I can't say with certainty since I have hit my limit. I find the syntax of threading to be much easier to read than the syntax for async.
