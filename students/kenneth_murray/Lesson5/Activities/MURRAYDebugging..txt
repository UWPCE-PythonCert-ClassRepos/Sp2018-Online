What is wrong with our logic?
	a) There is no return other than true. There should be a return of false if n==2 is not true.
	b) The function will keep looping unless n==2...not termination if it does not ==2.

Why doesn't the function stop calling itself?
	the function will keep looping until n==2..there is not termination or catch for any other case.


What's happening to the value of 'n' as the function gets deeper and deeper into recursion?
	The value keeps getting cut in half..


The examples for the pdb were not working for me. used pycharm to debug.
It showed that n was returning a value lower than 2...
When I stepped through the code with a value of 19, there was an exception when n was equal to 1.348485..
