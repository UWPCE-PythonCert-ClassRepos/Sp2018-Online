In the lesson content, we asked you to spend 5-10 minutes on your own debugging the recursion error exercise code.
After doing so, please provide:

1. In very general terms, use a couple of sentences to address the problem with our code. For example, give your
best guess or insight on the following questions:
- What is wrong with our logic?
- Why doesn't the function stop calling itself?
- What's happening to the value of 'n' as the function gets deeper and deeper into recursion?
2. A copy-and-paste of your terminal debugging activity.
